The Problem
========================================================

The amount of CO2 in the world is rising fast, and continues to grow.

This causes global warming, resulting in:
- Less fertile grounds to support a growing population
- Rising sea levels
- Endangering animal species

The problem will only become larger:
- population grows fast
- higher incomes in emerging markets mean higher energy and fuel consumption

Your grass can help fight this problem!
========================================================

Plants turn CO2 into O2, literally given mankind more oxygen to breath.

Grass in particular converts a lot of CO2 into oxygen.

So your grass can help save the world!

How much does my grass contribute?
========================================================

A new app, called CO2UptakeGrass, calculates for your specific grass how much CO2 it converts into oxygen.

It needs three inputs:
- how much CO2 there is in the ambient
- the exact species (either Quebec or Mississippi)
- and whether you chilled your grass the night before or not

Does it matter what kind of grass I have?
=========================================================
Not convinced?

Average uptake Quebec plant:

```
[1] 33.54286
```

Average uptake Mississippi plant:

```
[1] 20.88333
```
